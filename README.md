# FourBar
A node.js program for a fourbar position analysis using the vector method. This library encompasses only the angles of all the links and their position vectors. I will be adding a Crank-Slider and fully documenting how to use this library.


Eventually I will probably add a fivebar and a sixbar but for now only four. If you feel this is useful to you or someone you know, by all means share it or contribute!
