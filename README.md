# FourBar
A node.js program for a fourbar position analysis using the vector method. This library encompasses only the angles of all the links and their position vectors. I will be adding a Crank-Slider and fully documenting how to use this library.


Eventually I will probably add a fivebar and a sixbar but for now, only four. If you feel this is useful to you or someone you know, by all means share it or if you can add this library, contribute!
